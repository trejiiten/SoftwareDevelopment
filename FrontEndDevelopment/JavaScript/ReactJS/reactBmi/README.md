BMI Calculator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Run <code>npm start</code> to view the project.

This project was based upon an Eduonix Tutorial offered at [Zenva Academy](https://academy.zenva.com) as part of a React Series.

Move the sliders to determine your height and weight in both the Imperial measurement system and the Metric system. Those sliders will then determine your BMI.
