React Contact Manager

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Run <code>npm start</code> to view the project.

This project was based upon an Eduonix Tutorial offered at [Zenva Academy](https://academy.zenva.com) as part of a React Series.

This project utilizes [React](https://reactjs.org), [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), and [React-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io). The information is called from the [JSON Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

The archetecture of this project is still somewhat confusing, but I am beginning to understand why certain components are outside of the DOM components (ex actions, constants, distpatcher, store, utilities).
