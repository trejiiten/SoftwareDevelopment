This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project utilizes react-bootstrap, bootstrap v3.3.7, and jQuery (for bootstrap usage);

Problem: Due to country, the search seems to have problems due to a lack of thumbnail image which then throws an error and the entire app shuts down. will need to make some sort of conditional that sorts things out.
