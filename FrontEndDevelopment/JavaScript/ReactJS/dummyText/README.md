Dummy Text Generator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Run <code>npm start</code> to view the project.

This project was based upon an Eduonix Tutorial offered at [Zenva Academy](https://academy.zenva.com) as part of a React Series.

This projects pulls dummy text from [HipsterJesus](https://http://hipsterjesus.com). Originally it was able to access multiple paragraphs, but for some reason, the API's structure has since changed and things have not worked like I had expected.
