    "bio":"I am a violinist turned marketer turned ESL educator turned self-taught programmer. I current specialize in JavaScript (ECMAScript 5 and 6) along with an extra focus on React js. I believe that if something does not yet exist, it can be built. I am a creative thinker that also enjoys long walks along just about anything. When I am not trying to better myself by learning programming, I am either teaching a variety of South Korean adults English, or walking in excess of 20km a day (that means a pair of shoes does not last longer than a year). When I have time, I volunteer as a Cub Scout leader for the area of Seoul that I live. I have certification to lead cub scouts, and once I have returned to the states, I plan to receive certification to be a scout leader to young adults. If you want, I can even teach useful scouting knots that could one day save someone's life (or at least make a damn fine tent).",
